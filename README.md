# Snake
A recreation of the game of snake for a MAX7219 LED dot matrix

## Goals for this project
* To develop my C++ skills, extending the knowledge I gained from my degree
* To put the framework for documentation that I learned in ENGGEN 131 (uni course) in practice
* To explore low level programming and embedded engineering -> to work with a microcontroller and electronics to make something.
* To create something cool with Arduino!
